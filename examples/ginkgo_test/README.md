[go-testing]: https://golang.org/pkg/testing/
[ginkgo]: https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo

Using the `cbtest` framework with [Ginkgo][ginkgo] as the test runner.

```
ginkgo -v ./examples/ginkgo_test/
```

Please note that Ginkgo is more complex than Golang's own [testing][go-testing]
package; so if you don't know what to pick go with the latter.
